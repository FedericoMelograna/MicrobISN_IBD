in this folder, CALLING_comprimer_v3.R calls both comprimer_v3.R and comprimer_v3_interactions.R. The goal is to create a table as in C:\Users\fmelo\Documents\Github\Microbiome_drug_repurpose_ISN\Results\Limma\Edge-based\w_0\, where, grouping taxon per Genus, Family (or Taxon level itself), we see how many of the hits (i.e., an hit is a pair Taxon-Taxon that has adjusted p-value < .05), deemed significant with LIMMA are common in different cohort/drug/outcome combinations. 

In particular, comprimer_v3.R focus on finding  single Taxon more present in the various cohort/drug combinations while comprimer_v3_interactions.R finds the hits, i.e., the pairs of Taxa, that are shared among different combinations. Analogous analys are also done on the hits resulting from predicting different outcomes.
