# Graphs
 Collection of all graphical outcomes. 

> In the Alpha_beta diversity subfolder, there are graphs related to alpha beta diversity. The Alpha_Beta_explanaition.docx document goes into detail. 

> Analysis_Enterotype has the graphs, both in .png and .pdf versions, that are shown in the article for the enterotype analysis. Additionally, all bact2-bact2 ; bact2-other and other-other graphs are shown. 

> In Microbial_Fractional_abundances there are the stacked bars and pie charts for the abundances of the various cohorts + treatment + time, grouped per class, family and phylum. 

> Population_based_connections folder groups the population-based network for each cohort + time + treatment combination. These networks are shown based on their taxa, i.e., the lowest level, or the various taxa are grouped into their phyla and the edge weights are averaged. For this, we both took into account the weighted and the binary networks. 

> Taxa-level analysis folder contains the visual comparison of the differences in connectivity (i.e., edge weights) between the same cohort and treatment, but before and after treatment.
