PREDICTION (AUC) obtained with Random forest (stratified) and SVM (radial kernel) on all the different outcomes and datasets at w0 and w14_24

While we run the analysis on every combination {CD; UC} x {TNF; VDZ; UST} x {w0; w14; w24} x {Endoscopic; Biomarker; Clinical}, the guidelines are to consider primarily Endoscopic (as we reported in the paper) and, for follow-ups, the follow-up CD visit at w24 and the follow-up UC visit at w14. 


In the w_0 and w_14_24 folders, there are, for both RF and SVM, the list of the taxa, and taxa-taxa interactions, coming from all the RF(SVM) runs; in particular, these taxa are grouped by Genus, Family, or kept as Taxa. 
As before, the key outcome is the Endoscopic outcome (in agreement with https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38096956/).
